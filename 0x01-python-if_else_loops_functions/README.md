0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions

This repository offers Python examples and explanations of if/else expressions, loops, and functions. These notions are important building blocks in programming and are commonly utilised to regulate programme flow and conduct repeated operations. Understanding these ideas is critical for designing efficient and organised code.

If/Else Statements

If/else statements allow you to conditionally execute blocks of code based on certain conditions. They are used to make decisions in a program.



Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code. Python provides two types of loops: for loops and while loops.

For Loops

For loops are used when you want to iterate over a sequence of elements or perform a set number of iterations.


While Loops

While loops are used when you want to execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is True



Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They allow you to organize code into modular and reusable units. In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing optional parameters.
