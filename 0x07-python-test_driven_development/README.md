0x07. Python - Test-driven development


This project focuses on test-driven development (TDD) in Python. By the end of this project, you will have a solid understanding of the following concepts and be able to explain them to others without relying on external resources:

General

Why Python programming is awesome: This project aims to highlight the strengths and advantages of Python as a programming language.
What's an interactive test: Interactive tests refer to the process of executing tests in an interactive manner, where developers can actively participate in the testing process.
Why tests are important: Tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of code. They help identify bugs, validate functionality, and provide confidence in the code's behavior.
How to write Docstrings to create tests: Docstrings are strings included in the code that document its purpose, behavior, and usage. They can also be used to create tests by providing examples and expected outcomes.
How to write documentation for each module and function: Documentation is essential for maintaining and understanding code. It involves providing clear explanations and descriptions for each module and function, including their purpose, parameters, return values, and any important details.
What are the basic option flags to create tests: Option flags are used to configure and customize the behavior of tests. They can be used to specify test verbosity, coverage analysis, test selection, and more.
How to find edge cases: Edge cases are inputs or scenarios that are at the boundaries or extreme conditions of the code's expected behavior. Finding and testing these edge cases helps ensure the robustness and reliability of the code.
This project will provide hands-on experience and practical examples to reinforce these concepts. By practicing test-driven development, you will gain proficiency in writing tests, improving code quality, and increasing your overall programming skills in Python.
